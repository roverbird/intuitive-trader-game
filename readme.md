# Intuitive Trader Game

ðŸ”—[Play Intuitive Trader online](https://run.textvisualization.app/game/)

In this game, players are tasked with predicting the color of the next block in a sequence based on historical financial data. The blocks represent actual future returns of a real asset:

- **Black** represents negative returns.
- **Silver** represents insignificant returns.
- **Golden** represents large returns.

### How to Play:
1. **Start the Game**: Click the "Start!" button to fetch a sequence of historical return data.
2. **View the Sequence**: The game displays 12 colored blocks representing previous returns.
3. **Make Your Prediction**: After viewing the blocks, you need to guess the color of the next block in the sequence (Black, Silver, or Golden).
4. **Feedback**: If your guess is correct, your score increases. If incorrect, your score decreases.
5. **Continue**: The game will load the next sequence, and you continue guessing until the end of the data.

The goal is to predict the color of the next block correctly as many times as possible to accumulate points!.

### Overview

This repository is for the code for **Stage 1 MVP** (early demo) of a gamified platform designed to test and refine traders' intuition in financial predictions, using financial data provided by AI hedgefund.

The **Intuitive Trader Game** presents a novel approach to financial prediction: players predict market returns in the form of a card game, where each card corresponds to a potential return (high, insignificant, or negative). The goal is to investigate whether human intuition, when structured through gamification, can become a reliable tool for financial forecasting. If we gather enough data, we aim at benchmarking intuitive predictions at Numer.ai Crypto Contest.

In this **Stage 1 MVP**, we will focus on gathering initial data to assess whether any players can outperform random guessing, and whether patterns of consistent success can emerge.

### Key Features of the Paper

The idea behind the project is to:
- **Gamify Financial Prediction**: Participants are presented with sequences of obfuscated, abstracted historical market data and are asked to predict future returns by choosing the next "block" in a shuffled deck of several possible outcomes (targets).
- **Test Intuition-Based Predictions**: The game encourages intuitive decision-making (System 1 thinking) rather than analytical models or knowledge-based decisions.
- **Data-Driven Validation**: The predictions of successful players are aggregated and evaluated against machine learning models in financial modeling competitions like Numer.ai.
- **Stage 1 MVP Goal**: The first phase focuses on testing whether we can identify players who consistently perform above random chance, signaling that their intuition might have predictive value.
